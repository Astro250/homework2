I first changed the number of iterations and ngrid in jacobi.f90 so that it
would run for about 5 minutes in pure MPI node (i.e., OMP_NUM_THREADS=1). I then
reran using 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 OpenMP threads. I set a time limit of 10
minutes, so the job didn't finish in 10 minutes, the runtime provided below is
an extrapolation based on the fraction of the iterations it finished in 10
minutes. 


OMP_NUM_THREADS         runtime
----------------------------------
1                       4:46
2                       4:50 
4                       4:56
8                       6:32
16                     11:20
32
